            <p>The <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as <em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
